        ## Implementation Notes for Copilot Agent
        
        **Analysis Required:**
        - [ ] Assess technical feasibility within current system architecture
        - [ ] Identify impact on existing functionality
        - [ ] Estimate development complexity and effort
        - [ ] Consider user experience and interface changes needed
        - [ ] Evaluate database schema changes if required
        
        **Implementation Approach:**
        1. **Requirements Analysis:** Break down the feature into specific, testable requirements
        2. **Design Review:** Consider how this fits with existing code structure and patterns
        3. **Database Impact:** Determine if new fields or collections are needed
        4. **API Changes:** Identify new endpoints or modifications to existing ones
        5. **Frontend Updates:** Plan user interface changes and user experience flow
        6. **Testing Strategy:** Define how to validate the feature works correctly
        
        **Technical Considerations:**
        - **Backend:** May need updates to `src/backend/routers/activities.py` and `database.py`
        - **Frontend:** Likely requires changes to `src/static/app.js` and `index.html`
        - **Data Model:** Consider impact on `initial_activities` structure and MongoDB schema
        - **Authentication:** Ensure proper teacher/student permissions are maintained
        - **Performance:** Consider impact on page load and database queries
        
        **Implementation Priority:**
        - Focus on core functionality first
        - Ensure minimal disruption to existing features
        - Consider phased implementation for complex features
        - Maintain system simplicity and ease of maintenance
        
        **Validation:**
        - Implement feature according to acceptance criteria
        - Test all user scenarios described
        - Verify no regression in existing functionality
        - Ensure feature works across different browsers/devices
